# foodrescue
This repository houses cleaning and plotting functions for the Food Rescue Network. The repo was created as a part of the larger effort to streamline the FRN's data collection and analysis process, and make sure that our code is reproducible for future data analyst board members. Please store corrected survey data and static reports here.

The functions and code build off the Fall 2024 FRN report by Zoe Khan and Anabel Fletcher.

Installation:
