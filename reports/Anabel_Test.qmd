Fall 2024: 4480.9 lb 19 shifts per week

```{r}
4480.9/19
```

235.8368 per shift slot for the semester

Spring 2025: 2433.32 lb 17 shifts per week

```{r}
235.8368*17

235.8368*2
```

If we kept up at the same rate with a different number of shifts, we would have collected 4009.226 lb

471.6736 lb can be attributed to fewer shifts
